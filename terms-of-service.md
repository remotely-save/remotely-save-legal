We've decided to make this Privacy Policy available under a [Creative Commons Sharealike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license, which means that you're more than welcome to copy them, adapt them, and repurpose them for your own use.

Terms of Service
----------------

These Terms govern your access to and use of the software, applications, Obsidian plugins, extensions, and other products and services we provide through or for [remotelysave.com](https://remotelysave.com/) (our "Services").

Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to be bound by all of the Terms and all other operating rules, policies, and procedures that we may publish via the Services from time to time (collectively, the "Agreement"). You also agree that we may automatically change, update, or add on to our Services as stated in the Terms, and the Agreement will apply to any changes.

1\. Who's Who
-------------

"You" means any individual or entity using our Services. If you use our Services on behalf of another person or entity, you represent and warrant that you're authorized to accept the Agreement on that person's or entity's behalf, that by using our Services you're accepting the Agreement on behalf of that person or entity, and that if you, or that person or entity, violates the Agreement, you and that person or entity agree to be responsible to us.

We refer to Remotely Save dev team collectively as "Remotely Save," "us," or "we" throughout these Terms.

2\. Your Account
----------------

When using our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information and to keep the information current so that we can communicate with you about your account. We may need to send you emails about notable updates (like changes to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy), or to let you know about legal inquiries or complaints we receive about the ways you use our Services so you can make informed choices in response.

We may limit your access to our Services until we're able to verify your account information, like your email address.

When you create a remotelysave.com account, we consider that to be an inquiry about our products and services, which means that we may also contact you to share more details about what we have to offer (i.e., marketing). Don't worry â€” if you aren't interested, you can opt out of the marketing communications, whether it's an email, phone call, or text message.

You're solely responsible and liable for all activity under your account. You're also fully responsible for maintaining the security of your account (which includes keeping your password secure). We're not liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of your acts or omissions. If you get fired because of a blog post you write about your boss, that's on you.

Don't share or misuse your access credentials. And notify us immediately of any unauthorized uses of your account, store, or website, or of any other breach of security. If we believe your account has been compromised, we may suspend or disable it.

If you register as a user or otherwise use our Services, you represent that you're at least 13 (or 16 in Europe). You may use our Services only if you can legally form a binding contract with us.

4\. Responsibility of Visitors and Users
----------------------------------------

We haven't reviewed, and can't review, all of the content (like text, photo, video, audio, code, computer software, items for sale, and other materials) posted to or made available through our Services by users or anyone else ("Content") or on websites that link to, or are linked from, our Services. We're not responsible for any use or effects of Content or third-party websites. So, for example:

-   We don't have any control over third-party websites.
-   A link to or from one of our Services does not represent or imply that we endorse any third-party website.
-   We don't endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate, useful, or not harmful. Content could be offensive, indecent, or objectionable; include technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, or other errors; or violate or infringe the privacy, publicity rights, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights of third parties.
-   You're fully responsible for the Content available on your website, and any harm resulting from that Content. It's your responsibility to ensure that your website's Content abides by applicable laws and by the Agreement.
-   We aren't responsible for any harm resulting from anyone's access, use, purchase, or downloading of Content, or for any harm resulting from third-party websites. You're responsible for taking the necessary precautions to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.
-   We are not a party to, and will have no responsibility or liability for, any communications, transactions, interactions, or disputes between you and the provider of any Content.

Please note that additional third-party terms and conditions may apply to Content you download, copy, purchase, or use.

5\. Fees, Payment, and Renewal
------------------------------

**Fees for Paid Services.** Some of our Services are offered for a fee, like certain [remotelysave.com plans](https://remotelysave.com/pricing/) (collectively, "Paid Services"). This section applies to any purchases of Paid Services.

By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees. Depending on the Paid Service, there may be different kinds of fees, like some that are one-time, recurring, revenue-based, or based on an advertising campaign budget that you set. For recurring fees (AKA subscriptions), your subscription begins on your purchase date, and we'll bill or charge you in the automatically-renewing interval (such as monthly, annually, or biennially) you select, on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time by contacting the relevant support team.

**Taxes.** To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees do not include applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, value-added, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges ("Taxes"). You're responsible for paying all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your purchases. If we're obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the fees you've paid or will pay, you're responsible for those Taxes, and we may collect payment from you.

**Payment.** You must provide accurate and up-to-date payment information. By providing your payment information, you authorize us to store it until you request deletion. If your payment fails, we suspect fraud, or Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time (for example, if you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services), we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to Paid Services without notice to you. You authorize us to charge any updated payment information provided by your bank or payment service provider (e.g., new expiration date) or other payment methods provided if we can't charge your primary payment method.

**Automatic Renewal.** By enrolling in a subscription, you authorize us to automatically charge the then-applicable fees and Taxes for each subsequent subscription period until the subscription is canceled. If you received a discount, used a coupon code, or subscribed during a free trial or promotion, your subscription will automatically renew for the full price of the subscription at the end of the discount period. This means that unless you cancel a subscription, it'll automatically renew and we'll charge your payment method(s). You must cancel at least one month before the scheduled end date of any annual subscription and at least 24 hours before the end of any shorter subscription period. The date for the automatic renewal is based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed. If you've purchased access to multiple services, you may have multiple renewal dates.

You can view your renewal date(s), cancel, or manage subscriptions in your settings.

**Fees and Changes.** We may change our fees at any time in accordance with these Terms and requirements under applicable law. This means that we may change our fees going forward, start charging fees for Services that were previously free, or remove or update features or functionality that were previously included in the fees. If you don't agree with the changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.

**Refunds.** We may have a refund policy for some of our Paid Services, and we'll also provide refunds if required by law. In all other cases, there are no refunds and all payments are final.

We may have a "no-show policy" for some Paid Services that require your participation. This means that if you don't show up for, don't participate in, or are late for a scheduled session, you'll still be charged for the Paid Service and won't be entitled to a refund.

*European Users:* 

You have the right to withdraw from the transaction within fourteen (14) days from the date of the purchase without giving any reason as long as your purchase was not of downloadable content or of a customized nature, and (i) the service has not been fully performed, or (ii) subject to other limitations as permitted by law. For digital content, you agree that any purchase of digital content will be made available to you immediately and as a result you waive any right of withdrawal to such content.

If you cancel this contract, we will reimburse you all payments we have received from you, including delivery costs (with the exception of additional costs resulting from the fact that you have chosen a type of delivery other than the most favorable standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and no later than within fourteen days from the day on which we received the notification of your cancellation of this contract. For this repayment, we will use the same means of payment that you used for the original transaction, unless expressly agreed otherwise with you; you will not be charged for this repayment. If we have already begun our services during the withdrawal period, you will pay us a prorated amount corresponding to the services already provided up to the time you notify us of the exercise of the withdrawal right compared to the total scope of the services provided for in the contract. If you cancel your contract with us, you will refrain from using the digital content or digital services or making them available to third parties.

You may exercise your right to withdrawal by contacting us (see below).

6\. Feedback
------------

We love hearing from you and are always looking to improve our Services. When you share comments, ideas, or feedback with us, you agree that we're free to use them without any restriction or compensation to you.

European Users: If we cause damage to you and you are a consumer in Europe, we limit our liability to the maximum amount permissible in your country of residence. Liability will be limited to foreseeable damages arising due to a breach of material contractual obligations typical for this type of contract. Remotely Save isn't liable for damages that result from a non-material breach of any other applicable duty of care.

You and we agree that we and our affiliates' total liability is limited to the greater of $50 or the amount paid by you to use our Services during the 12 months preceding the claim; To the extent that our liability is limited or excluded, the limitations or exclusions will also apply to the personal liability of our employees, legal representatives, and vicarious agents.
